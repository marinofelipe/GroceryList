// selecting a row will animate price subview
    // animate text field from row frame

// while receiving input the price text will format content as currency

// price text filed will appear as subview of the collection view or main view
// will be a nice looking text field waiting for the user to input value

// clicking outside the price text field would dismiss it
// clicking ok in the keyboard would confirm the value and add the row to the bought section
